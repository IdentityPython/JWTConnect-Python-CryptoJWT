JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
=========================

JSON Web Encryption (JWE) represents encrypted content using JSON-based data
structures.

It is assumed that you know all you need to know about key handling if not
please spend some time reading keyhandling_ .

When it comes to JWE there are basically 2 things you want to be able to do:
encrypt some data and decrypt some encrypted data. I'll deal with
them in that order.

Encrypting a document
---------------------

This is the high level way of doing things.
There are a few steps you have to go through. Let us start with an example and then break it into its parts::

    >>> from cryptojwt.jwk.rsa import RSAKey
    >>> from cryptojwt.jwe.jwe import JWE

    >>> priv_key = import_private_rsa_key_from_file(KEY)
    >>> pub_key = priv_key.public_key()
    >>> encryption_key = RSAKey(use="enc", pub_key=pub_key, kid="some-key-id")
    >>> plain = b'Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of ...'
    >>> encryptor = JWE(plain, alg="RSA-OAEP", enc="A256CBC-HS512")
    >>> jwe = encryptor.encrypt(keys=[encryption_key], kid="some-key-id")

The steps:

    1. You need an encryption key. The key *MUST* be an instance of
       :py:class:`cryptojwt.jwk.JWK`.
    2. You need the information that is to be signed. It must be in the form of a string.
    3. You initiate the encryptor, provide it with the message and other
       needed information.
    4. And then you encrypt as described in RFC7516_ .

There is a lower level way of doing the same, it will look like this::

    >>> from cryptojwt.jwk.rsa import import_private_rsa_key_from_file
    >>> from cryptojwt.jwe.jwe_rsa import JWE_RSA

    >>> priv_key = import_private_rsa_key_from_file('certs/key.pem')
    >>> pub_key = priv_key.public_key()
    >>> plain = b'Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of ...'
    >>> _rsa = JWE_RSA(plain, alg="RSA-OAEP", enc="A128CBC-HS256")
    >>> jwe = _rsa.encrypt(pub_key)

Here the key is an cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPrivateKey
instance and the encryptor is a :py:class:`cryptojwt.jwe.jew_rsa.JWE_RSA`
instance.

Decrypting something encrypted
------------------------------

Decrypting using the encrypted message above.

    >>> from cryptojwt.jwe.jwe import factory
    >>> from cryptojwt.jwk.rsa import RSAKey

    >>> _decryptor = factory(jwe, alg="RSA-OAEP", enc="A128CBC-HS256")
    >>> _dkey = RSAKey(priv_key=priv_key)
    >>> msg = _decryptor.decrypt(jwe, [_dkey])

or if you know what you're doing::

    >>> _decryptor = JWE_RSA()
    >>> msg = _decryptor.decrypt(jwe, priv_key)
