How to deal with Cryptographic keys
===================================

Absolutely vital to doing cryptography is to be able to handle keys.
This document will show you have to accomplish this with this package.

CryptoJWT deals with keys by defining 4 'layers'.

    1. At the bottom we have the keys as used by the cryptographic package
       (in this case cryptography_) .
    2. Above that we have something we call a JSON Web Key. The base class
       here is :py:class:`cryptojwt.jwk.JWK`. This class can import keys in
       a number of formats and can export a key as a JWK_.
    3. A :py:class:`cryptojwt.key_bundle.KeyBundle` keeps track of a set of
       keys that has the same origin. Like being part of a JWKS_.
    4  A :py:class:`cryptojwt.key_jar.KeyJar` lastly is there to sort the keys
       by who owns them.


I will not describe who to deal with keys in layer 1, that is done best by
cryptography_. So, I'll start at layer 2.
